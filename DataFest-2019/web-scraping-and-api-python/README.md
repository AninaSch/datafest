Web Scraping and Web APIs
---------------------------------------------------------

Researchers often need to retrieve data from a web service and
assemble it into a usable data set. This workshop will teach you the
basic tools and techniques needed to do that. We will learn how to
monitor and inspect network activity using web development tools built
in to popular web browsers, and how to automate data retrieval using
Python.

Prerequisites and Preparation
-----------------------------

We will have hands on exercises. If you wish to participate please
install the [Chrome web browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Python 3.7 version)
