Bayesian Modeling with Stan
============================================================

Description
---------------------------------------------------------

This workshop will briefly cover the intuition of Bayesian inference and then introduce the Stan computer language, which uses Bayesian inference to estimate the unknown parameters of a model. The Stan language is free and open-source and can be interfaced from other free and open-source languages for data analysis such as R, Python, and Julia. Workshop participants will build incrementally more realistic models for success at a task, specifically success at putting in golf, and learn how to evaluate competing models in a Bayesian fashion.


Prerequisites
-----------------------------

None


Set-up instructions
-----------------------------

We will have hands on exercises. If you wish to participate, you can do so in one of two ways:

1. run Stan remotely in the cloud (**recommended**). Stan can be run remotely using the [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) cloud platform, which also includes installations of R, Python, Julia, and a C++ toolchain. We have CoCalc accounts available for free to workshop participants. If you would like to use a CoCalc account for the session:  
**YOU MUST SEND AN EMAIL TO <sworthington@iq.harvard.edu> REQUESTING AN ACCOUNT BEFORE 9am January 23rd**.

2. run Stan locally on your laptop. You will need to install a [Stan interface](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/index.html) to your favorite scripting language. You will also need to make sure you have a working C++ toolchain on your machine.


This [github repository](https://github.com/IQSS/datafest/tree/master/DataFest-2019/bayesian-modeling-with-stan) contains the workshop materials.
