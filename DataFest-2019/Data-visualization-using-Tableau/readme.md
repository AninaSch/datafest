# Data Visualization Using Tableau
To prepare for this workshop, please download <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/">Tableau Public</a> and the three CSVs you can find at <a href="http://bit.ly/DF-Tableau-2019">bit.ly/DF-Tableau-2019</a>. 

You’ll have to create a free Tableau Public account as well as install some software to your desktop. Make sure to keep your Tableau Public username/password handy, because in order to save, you’ll need to sign in to Tableau Public in the desktop app and put your project on the cloud.  

Note: This workshop will move quickly through Tableau basics to create more complicated visuals, so playing around with the interface ahead of the workshop is encouraged.
