# Basic Text Analysis with Voyant Tools

This workshop will use materials that you can find at [https://bit.ly/DFVoyant](bit.ly/DFVoyant). That folder contains both the presentation slides and sample data that we'll be using. Please make sure you can download the files before the workshop.

You can use the online version of [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), but I also recommend checking out the local version, [Voyant Server](https://github.com/sgsinclair/VoyantServer). Either will work, but Voyant Server runs locally and has been more stable for me in the past. For Voyant Server, just follow the instructions on the GitHub page.
