### Summary ###
The two parts to this lecture are the good seeds you will sow for the years of research you are about to begin, or even if you are mid-stream. The first part will frame your approach, presenting guidelines and examples on organizing your work (planning, electronically), discussing frameworks for the metadata about your research and the data itself to capture and document, and executing your data management plan. Just as important as planning, the second part of this lecture will highlight what tools, utilities, and setup can help transform your computing environment so that you can efficient and productive!
