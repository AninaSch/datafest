# Version Control with Git/Github

## What is version control?

Version control (revision control or source control) is the task of keeping maintaining and tracking changes in documents and/or code. There are various tools available to enable this, and each one has its strengths and weaknesses. For today's session we will be using *Git* which is a very commonly used tool with an online component *Github*. 

## Why use version control?

There are many reasons to use version control, the most obvious one is keeping track of changes made in various versions of a text document; thus enabling restoration of an older version, collaborations and tracking bugs in code.

## Versioning tools

As mentioned earlier, there are several tools available for this. Some will allow you to version on a local computer (personal or shared), others have local and online components. The latter ones have multiple models: e.g. (Subversion)[http://subversion.apache.org/] (SVN) wherein all colaborators directly modify a single shared repository, and alternatively (Git)[https://git-scm.com/], which is a distributed system wherein collaborators work locally and share changes as a separate step. (Here is a more complete list)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software] of version control tools.

The word **Repository**, used above, is the structure that stores all the information related to a given project, including the metadata, the changes, the data, etc. We will be creating and using a repository with Git/Github today.

## Session Overview

To make this session more user-friendly for anyone not familiar with the Linux command line interface, we will be using (Github Desktop)[https://desktop.github.com/]. You should already have this installed on your laptops if you plan to participate in hands-on activities. 

In addition to using Github Desktop for working locally, we will be using (github.com)[http://github.com] to access our new repository.

### Github Desktop (local Git)

#### Create a Github account

#### Download files
> [Directory of potential files for download](https://github.com/IQSS/datafest/tree/master/versioning/data)

#### Create a new repository

#### Add and modify files (modify, add and commit)

#### Sync (pull and/or push)

### Github online
