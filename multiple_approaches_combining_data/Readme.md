## Multiple Approaches to Combining Data
Wednesday January 18, 2017 1:00pm - 2:15pm <br>
Tsai Auditorium CGIS South, 1730 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138

Overview at http://sched.co/8sVf

Modern-day research requires merging data sets from multiple sources while maintaining consistency and integrity. This workshop will discuss the fundamentals of using a lightweight database like SQLite to achieve those goals, which opens up the powerful world of SQL. We will also explore examples in which various analysis tools like R, Stata, and Python, can access, interrogate, and combine this information with little effort.
